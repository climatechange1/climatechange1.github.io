					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Climate change is currently a major poltical. If no action is taken to reduce global warming, it
						will cause major lasting effects that can not be reversed. It effects include "extreme weather
						events,declining air quality, and destablizing natural systems due to increase in greenhouse gas
						emissions"(Climate Change and Human Health). <br>
						As you progress through this website I will present how climate change will effect you and how
						you can take action to prevent climate change from getting worse. So, you can enjoy this earth
						and
						its resources as my generation and generations before have enjoyed this earth. </p>

					<h2>Warming Oceans</h2>
					<p>Oceans are major carbon sink meaing they absorb alot of carbon dixoide overtime.
						However, with more carbon dixoide being released then ocean can not handle means ocean are
						getting exteremly hot. Which results in ocean absorbing less
						carbon dixoide from the atmosphere. Also, Hotter ocean leads to fish moving toward the north
						pole where the cold ocean is, which leads to fishing industries
						being severely
						hurt and also hurting communities that live near the ocean and rely on it for there as there
						main consumption and livelihood.

					<h2>Melting Ice Sheets</h2>
					<p>Another major effect of is melting ice sheets which causes sea levels to rise, meaning flooding
						will
						increase due to it and also cities near the ocean and beaches can potentially come under water.
						"Approximately Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and
						2016"(NASA).
						"The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade"(NASA). This leads to more
						warming, earth overall will be much hotter and in the tropics some places can become inhabitat,
						leading emigration from these lands.

					<h2>Extreme Events</h2>
					<p>
						Change is climate change has another danger which is increase in extreme events. Due to rising
						sea levels and
						hotter weather there will be increase in extreme natural events such Hurricane, Tornado, Heat
						Waves, Increasing amount of
						Rainfalls, and Wildfire. Most of these cause major disruption to daily lives to those affected
						by it. Increases in wildfires
						is already prominent in areas such as Australia and California;
						these areas were heavily affected last year and will most likely be affected this year aswell.

					<h2>These are just a few places that have been affected by climate change.</h2>
					<p> If no action is taken by us then more and more places will become victim
						of climate change. We might not be directly affected with changes but
						increase in hurricans and forest fires cause major damage to the economy.
						<br>
						<br>
						In 2018, California wildfires caused $400 billion damage, $80 billion damage in
						2019.<br>
						<br>
						Hurrican Katrina which was one of the most devasting hurricane caused $125 billion damage.

					<h2>How you can help</h2>
					<p>While you might not be able make a change on big scale. You can definitely make changes 
							to your lifestyle that will decrease your carbon footprint and slow down climate change.
							You can reduce your carbon footprint by using the three R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle.
							<Br><Br>
							Reduce your use of plastic products such as spoons, forks, and plates. When doing a takeout
							ask resturant to include only things you need such as if you do not want forks and spoons if 
							you already have them at home.
							<Br><Br>
							Reuse is one of the simplest things to include in your lifestyle. For example, instead using plastic 
							water bottles and then throwing them away just use a water bottle container. Instead of using
							a paper bag and plastic ziplock your lunch instead use plastic container with lids.
							While some of these cost more upfront however in the long run they help you save more, and 
							simultaneously reduce your carbon footprint.	
							<Br><Br>
							Recyle is the easiest method to reduce your carbon footprint and that is to just
							recyle your waterbottles, metals cans, paper, etc.
